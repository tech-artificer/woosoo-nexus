# How to Toggle Menu Availability

## Purpose
Mark menu items as sold out or back in stock to prevent orders for unavailable items.

## Steps
1. Navigate to "Menus" from the sidebar
2. Find the item you want to update
3. Click the availability toggle switch next to the item
4. The change takes effect immediately across all devices

## Expected Outcome
- **Sold Out:** Item appears grayed out on tablets with "Sold Out" label
- **Available:** Item appears normally and can be ordered

## Tips
- Availability changes sync in real-time to all connected tablets
- Use bulk actions to update multiple items at once during opening/closing
