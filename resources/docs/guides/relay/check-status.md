# How to Check Connection Status

## Status Indicators
The relay app main screen shows:
- **Server Connection:** Green = Connected, Red = Disconnected
- **Printer Connection:** Green = Connected, Yellow = Paired but not connected, Red = Not paired
- **Last Print Job:** Timestamp of most recent print

## Viewing Detailed Status
1. Open the relay app
2. Main screen displays:
   - Device name and token (last 4 characters)
   - Server connection status
   - Printer connection status
   - Network signal strength
   - Battery level (important!)

## Print Job History
1. Tap the **History** or **Logs** button
2. View list of recent print jobs:
   - Order ID
   - Timestamp
   - Status (Success/Failed)
   - Error message (if any)
3. Tap a log entry to see full details
4. Use **Reprint** button to reprint a previous job

## Network Diagnostics
1. Tap **Settings** > **Diagnostics**
2. View:
   - WiFi SSID and signal strength
   - Server ping response time
   - Last successful connection timestamp
3. Tap **Test Connection** to verify server reachability

## Expected Outcome
All indicators should show green status during normal operation. Print jobs appear in history with "Success" status.

## When to Check Status
- At start of each shift
- After any network interruption
- When orders aren't printing as expected
- Before closing for the day
